This is the final group project from my Mthree Program. This project is a full-stack application which allows users to search up songs and add them to a custom playlist that they created. The front-end of the project was built with React + Vite and Bootstrap. The backend is a spring applicatoin with a JDBC template using an SQL database to store information from user and the Spotify API
